### Meta Notes 

Tesan was written as a comic, few times, and it started off as comedy somehow (to be fair, it was actually funny), but slowly became darker and gore-ish. I don't really have anything to compare it to. Maybe like Tokyo Ghoul, with the gore and the forced suffering. 

I literally put my two hyperfixations (volcanoes and hurricanes) into one. Unfortunately, I lost majority of hurricane and volcano content I have collected over the years. 

Lowkey just re-read the first version and it's funny as fuck. I was right. Old me had a fantastic sense of humor. 

This article is not complete, and is subject to change. 

## General Information 

## Synopsis 

Prior to becoming the fused self, it is implied that the to-be Tesan, who was called Connor then, was homeless and overall struggling to live. He lived around a subway station trying to find ways to make living. At some point, he considered suicide and went down to the train station to do so. Before the attempt, he encountered a mother who had recently lost their child. She advised him not to give up so soon, and that one will find hope in the darkest of life.  

Connor found a flyer for a paid, human experimentation in a nearby town of `Eduwin`. Realizing there is no going further down from his point, he reached out to the creator of the flyer. The creator was Sani, the manifestation of the infamous volcano Eyjafjallajokull. He told Tesan that his experiment is cancelled and he simply forgot to take down the poster. He also mentions the experiment is incredibly risky and untested. Connor asks Sani to conduct the experiment on him anyway, believing he had nothing left to lose. 

> Realistically, this would be a terrible, and an impossible scenario. Sani's "lab" is simply his home, and from what is known, was not funded by any scientific or reliable organizations. Such an "experiment" has little difference from making soneone try out cocaine from a local drug dealer, I suppose. But I was like 13 at the time of writing, and Tesan was written in one afternoon. So I didn't know better lmao. 

Connor signs the experiment contract and Sani reluctantly conducts the experiment, using a machine called `T-9`, putting his own molten rock samples and some rainwater from a clueless, stupid, and possibly drunk typhoon manifestation, Soulik, into the machine and into Connor's system. Sani requests Connor to stay overnight as the machine works on him. Sani leaves the lab, leaving half-conscious Soulik in the lab as well. 

The next day, Sani visits the lab, with Soulik saying he hears something in the machine. Sani looks inside to witness an abomination between a typhoon, volcano, and a human. Sani explains to Connor that he is a human with irreversible manifestations of a volcano and a typhoon, first of its kind in the world. Although Connor signed the contract, Sani offers to help him out of sympathy. Soulik was not part of the experiment other than providng Connor's typhoon manifestation. He took one look at Tesan and ran (or, in this case, flew? drifted?) away. 

Sani gives Connor the name Tesan, which is literally the Korean words typhoon and volcano put together. He also asks Tesan if he feels anything, or if he gained any abilities. Tesan mentions he could not fly like a typhoon, and feels pain. He was also able to open a "screen" where he can communicate with other volcanoes (in this world, every volcano can communicate with one another through dormancy or dreams). Sani reviews his experiment and finds that Tesan is 69% typhoon and 31% volcano, from Soulik and Sani respectively (and yes, the number 69 is chosen for the reason you think). In the meantime, Tesan expresses pain and drowsiness. 

Sani explains to Tesan the pain is from the volcano side of his physique and Sani himself feels it often. Likely from the molten rock melting his volcano part and human part of his body. Tesan gained the ability to touch and manipulate molten rock, lava, and have a strong, internal source of heat. But being part volcano, he is required to enter periods of dormancy and eruptions. He also gained the ability to use latent heat and create powerful winds, rain, storm surge, and possibly fly. However, Sani mentioned it is likely Tesan will never be able to fly as his volcano side is too heavy for it. 

Tesan remained bedridden for the most part, taking painkillers and sleeping most of the day. He was able to adapt to the new body, but still had difficulty eating or moving around. Tesan couldn't eat well, and his human side weakened. His typhoon side remained strong as the volcano side of Tesan provided him heat. 

While teaching Tesan to live as a part-volcano, Sani attempts to call Soulik to help him with his other side. Soulik was too busy being drunk in "hurricane parties" to answer. Sani and Tesan decides to visit Soulik in-person (or in-cyclone I suppose) to ask him for help. 

Sani and Tesan leave the lab for the first time, and Tesan is humilated by the public for looking hideous and mutant. His emission of sulfur scared away people and animals. Heartbroken, Tesan returns home without finding Soulik. He practices his volcanic dreaming and dormant ability. Volcanoes live through dormancy through lucid dreams, and he was able to allow others to partially enter his dreams. His dreams allows one to feel like they were there longer and shorter. Completely altering their preception of time. 

Tesan also explore his typhoon abilities, and figure out the location of one of the typhoon headquarters, where Soulik lived. Sani and Tesan arrive at the headquarters and find Soulik. The three cause a commotion in the huracans region and eventually, the current leader of the atlantic hurricanes, Katrina, had to intervene. 

**Above is how far it went in the first comics. I mention that later on, the volcano side and the hurricane side sort of attack each other which leads to Tesan getting sick again**
